--Should I speedrun this game?
    No.

--Why do you speedrun this game?
    I don't know.

--What version do you speedrun on?
    This mostly depends on what maps / categories I'm running.
    For any of the original 5 campaigns I will be running on 2.0.0.8.
    Co-op runs will probably be on 2.0.0.8 or newest.
    Any other runs should be on the current steam version.

--Why do you sometimes reset twice in a row?
    When loading a level for the first time the bots will be able to move instantly, the next time the level is loaded the bots will stay in place for a while, making them easier to kill.

--Why do you play on easy difficulty?
    It's faster, this is a speedrun. The run does not have to be done at a fixed difficulty, so it is changed when needed (killing bots, dying faster in co-op).

--Why do you kill the bots?
    Bots are slow. I would have to wait for them to get to the saferoom to finish the level.
    Yes, I know you can kick the bots via console, but I do not do this as part of a normal run for reasons.

--Why aren't you doing this thing?
    Either it doesn't save any time, or I don't know it. If you think something will save time, feel free to say it.
